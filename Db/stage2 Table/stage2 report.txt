A table contains a line of attributes and a few lines of records. A list of a list of strings would be convenient to do some operations. 

So I rewrite the class Record to keep its type consistent with the table at this stage. That becomes much easier for me to write methods in class Table. 

In class Table, I design two kinds of methods, about table and operations on table. 
Table methods are methods for me to easily access a table and its features. Operation methods contain some operations like INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER.  Both delete and select operations allow us to apply to mutiple records. 

Fields are private to ensure robustness. Out-of-bound checkings are placed where necessary to make sure that programming is defensive. And of course, there are complete tests. 

I use row number to control common operations on a table at this stage. Each time when you successfully insert or delete a record of a table, rows shoud move down(rows++) or move up (rows--) a line.
